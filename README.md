## Introduction & Background
This project delves into the analysis of health insurance costs for US residents, exploring factors such as preexisting medical conditions, lifestyle choices, and dietary habits. Utilizing three datasets—the Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction, US Health Insurance, and Region-wise Obesity Prevalence—we aim to assist insurance providers in setting premiums, establishing reserve funds, and creating risk profiles. The project also aims to encourage healthier lifestyles, potentially categorizing individuals as "low risk" for insurance providers, leading to reduced premiums.

## Data Sets
### 1. Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction Dataset
- **Source:** Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) between 2000-2010.
- **Purpose:** Investigate and predict cardiovascular disease risks based on lifestyle factors.
- **Limitations:** U.S. focus, exclusion of certain risk factors, potential bias.

### 2. US Health Insurance Dataset
- **Source:** US Census Bureau, collected from the Current Population Survey (CPS).
- **Purpose:** Understand risk underwriting in health insurance, impact of insured attributes on premiums.
- **Limitations:** Small size (1338 cases), lacks details on underlying conditions.

### 3. US CDC Obesity Prevalence
- **Source:** US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
- **Purpose:** Track obesity trends and identify public health concerns.
- **Limitations:** Relies on self-reported height and weight, lacks details on contributors to obesity.

## Data Story
The data story unfolds in three parts:
1. **Impact of Control Variables on BMI Index:** Investigate the sensitivity of the BMI index to changes in variables like drinking habits, heart diseases, diabetes, gender, and lifestyle.

2. **State-wise BMI and Insurance Claim Patterns:** Showcase state-wise BMI and insurance claim patterns across the United States, using different sample survey results.

3. **Exploratory Analysis on Health Variables:** Analyze various health variables, including general health, health issues, and health index, to align analyses with broader health objectives.

## Concepts Covered
- **Bins (BMI Distribution):** Analyze the spread of BMI values.
- **Color by Dimension (BMI by Claim):** Investigate gender-based differences in BMI with respect to insurance claims.
- **Heatmaps (State-wise Analysis):** Visualize variations in average BMI and average insurance claims across different U.S. states.
- **Reference Line (Average Claims Comparison):** Compare average insurance claims among different BMI categories.

## Recommendations and Analysis
- **Gender-Based Pricing:** Explore potential gender-based health concerns and tailor insurance offerings accordingly.
- **Lifestyle Factors and Alcohol Consumption:** Encourage policyholders to adopt healthier lifestyles, though limited impact on BMI.
- **Impact of Diabetes:** Assess diabetes status and hospital visit frequency to mitigate the risk of higher claims.
- **Region-Specific Pricing Policies:** Understand state-wise variations in premiums and encourage healthier lifestyles.

## Summary & Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis, driven by three datasets, provides actionable insights for insurance providers, policymakers, and individuals. The project contributes strategic recommendations and insights to refine insurance strategies and promote healthier living. The limitations of the datasets are acknowledged, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach to policy customization based on age and associated diseases.
